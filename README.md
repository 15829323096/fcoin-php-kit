Calling the API v2 on Fcoin Exchange https://www.fcoin.com in php, base on the document https://developer.fcoin.com/en.html

Milestones:

1) implement basic REST API calls
2) implement websocket API with market data
3) implement some of the indicators base on the market data
4) let have auto trade, huh?
5) let me think :)
